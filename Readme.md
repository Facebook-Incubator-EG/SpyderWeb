# SpyderWeb
SpyderWeb is a Discord/Twitch bot that utilizes a modular approach to adding new functionality.  SpyderWeb utilizes .Net Core 2.2 and in developed in a console app.  The intent of the project is to be able to run the application on any system that has .Net Core 2.2 installed.

In order to run the project currently, you can download the source code, and build the application in release mode to a file.  Then run the file using `dotnet Program.cs` in the base folder.  You also need to copy the `config.example.json` file into `config.json` and fill in the values according to your tokens.

## Disclaimer
The project is still very much in development and even the architecture is undergoing massive changes.  Please feel free to leave comments as issues and I will gladly add any context, clarification, or changes when I can, as I see fit.
